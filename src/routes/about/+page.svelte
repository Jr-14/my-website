	</header>
	<p>Hi All! I am John Requizo.</p>
	<p>
		Integrations Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://doshii.com/">Doshii</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I completed my Bachelors of Computer Science in 2022 at Monash University. I have been coding
		professionaly for just over a year with Doshii, but I have had ~2 years of industry experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		I enjoy learning, and the processing of creating things. I think it's important to highlight the
		struggles and discomfort of learning and creating new things. In the end, prevailing over the
		struggle and knowing that we are more than capable is the reward of the process.
	</p>
	<p>I hope you'll find some cool projects, and articles here and how they came to fruition.</p>
